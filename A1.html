        <p>Space is the boundless, three-dimensional area in which objects and events have relative position and direction. It's
        often referred to as the "final frontier" and is characterized by being a nearly perfect vacuum, meaning it has very
        little matter and extremely low pressure. In space, sound cannot travel because there are not enough molecules close
        enough to transmit sound waves</p>
        <p>Outer space, or simply space, is the expanse that exists beyond Earth's atmosphere and between celestial bodies.[1] It
        contains ultra-low levels of particle densities, constituting a near-perfect vacuum[2] of predominantly hydrogen and
        helium plasma, permeated by electromagnetic radiation, cosmic rays, neutrinos, magnetic fields and dust. The baseline
        temperature of outer space, as set by the background radiation from the Big Bang, is 2.7 kelvins (−270 °C; −455 °F)</p>
